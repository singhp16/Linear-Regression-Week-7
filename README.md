# Linear-Regression-Week-7
Reflection on the Problem and Solution
This project aimed to predict an individual’s weight using healthcare-related features such as age, height, and exercise level, leveraging a Linear Regression model. The dataset, sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), required careful preprocessing due to missing values and variability in available features. Identifying and selecting the appropriate columns, handling missing data, and encoding categorical variables were critical steps to prepare the data for modeling. The model was trained and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction accuracy.

The results demonstrated that Linear Regression could capture the relationship between these basic health indicators and weight with reasonable accuracy. However, the model’s performance was limited by the quality and completeness of the data. Future improvements could include incorporating more relevant features, applying advanced modeling techniques, and addressing missing data more effectively. Overall, this project highlights the importance of thorough data preparation and offers a foundational approach for healthcare predictive modeling.
